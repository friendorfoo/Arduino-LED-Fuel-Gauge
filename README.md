Arduino-LED-Fuel-Gauge
======================

Finally have a proper Github going for this ancient project.

All in all I think the coding is not that bad considering my skills at the time. 
I am still proud of certain aspects of this project, especially the fact that the last LED blinks
when fuel is especially low.

It was definitly fuction over form, and it did it's job flawlessly for over a year.

Code 1 is .PDE file extension.
Code 2 is .INO  (the code is identical)

I apoligize to everyone who tried to download the code in the past but only got a broken link.

Logical improvements: If I knew better at the time, I would translate the analog input into a simple 1-100% reading
so that a user can adjust the settings to their own preferences in a much more intutive way. I hope someone who builds
this in the future will post this improvement, and others I havent even thought of.
